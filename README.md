This is my solution to the Makers Academy Week 7 weekend challenge.

As a user,
So I can view people's pictures
I want to be able to sign up

As a service provider,
To protect my users's privacy,
I want to prevent non users from viewing users pictures.

As a user,
So I can make people jealous of my lifestyle
I want to be able to upload pictures

As a user,
So I can let other users know what I think of their life,
I want to be able to leave comments on their pictures

As a user,
So I don't have to use my words to express my appreciation of others pictures,
I'd want to be able to 'like' other users pictures

Task
-----

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Bonus if you can write your own set of sensible user stories!

As usual please start by

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan_october2015 (if you haven't already)
* Forking this repo. After cloning your fork and cd'ing into it, you'll need to [initialize a Rails app in the current directory](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/).

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
